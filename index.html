      <h2>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      
            <p>My wife really enjoyed the website I created and My kiddos really like the pictures used 
for the website as well. All in all I just need to keep practicing getting my workflow down 
and getting the coding laguage communication down. I really like the front-end so far and
will definately be practicing this summer while at work to better sharpen my skills at web
developing. I was able to revise and get the pictures more centered on the web page. My son really like to pictures that I included on the page.</p>
      
      <h2>Thoughs on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      

      
      <p>Progressive enhancement is a great way to envision a model that will help you make content and 
design that can be as close as universal reach you can get so that people of all flavors can 
enjoy and digest content created.</p>

<p>With the M&M analogy is a great analogy based on the fact the content(peanut) is the most 
important peice of the puzzle. The content is what draws a person to view the page. 
Some people may like the chocloate M&Ms and with this model of progressive ehancement 
they could possibly be tempted to try the peanut M&M and be converted instrad of being just 
plain chocolate.</p>

<p>To really be good at progressive enhancement you have to have the ability to read the customer
beyond what they tell you by other cues. Personality, image and other detail thiungs can give you a map
of what to build around when making the M&M. Another ability is to know the time or era that is 
present, a person definately does not want to be stuck in an era that has passed. In all this was a very helpful
article and I enjoyed reading it.<p>
